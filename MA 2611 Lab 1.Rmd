## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**PROBLEM L.2**

```{r}
#a) & b)
points<- c(2413, 20310, 12637, 2753, 14505, 14440, 2379, 447, 345, 4784, 13803, 12668, 1235, 1257, 1671, 4041, 4145,

summary(points)

#c)
sd(points)

#d)
sorted_points<-sort(points)
print(sorted_points)

rank(sorted_points)



```

a.  The height of the lowest point in the US is 345. The highest point in the US is 20310.

b.  The average height of the highest points in the US is 6161. The median is 4590.

c.  The height of the highest points in the US vary by 5085.635 feet.

d.  Massachusetts rank 20th place among US states for the highest point in the country.

**Problem L.3**

```{r}
#a)
x <- c(seq(6, 12), rep(5.3, 3), -3, rep(c(1.2, 3.4, 5.6), 2))
print(x)

#b)
x<-rev(x)
print(x)

#c)
y<-c(x[1],median(x),x[length(x)])
print(y)

```

**Problem L.4**

```{r}

# Data : People I know 

# Numerical data : Favorite number & Ages

# Categorical Data : Sex
